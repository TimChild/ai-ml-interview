You’re helping design a solar-heated thermal storage vessel. You have three layer “building blocks”:

A) insulation jacket (low k)
B) air (or vacuum) gap with glass boundaries
C) high reflectivity/low-ε surface.

Task: Propose an ordering and rationale that maximizes heat retention while still allowing solar absorption where needed.
Then outline how you’d evaluate variants using simulation + ML.
